   "movie_description": "When was the last time you were amazed? When was the last time you confronted something with such wonder that you stood and just marvelled? There are two things that happen. First, you stop what you are doing and then admire what is wonderful. The night of Jesus’ birth, angels in heaven and humans on earth, stopped what they were doing and drew together in awe. And the angel said to them, “fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.” The start of Jesus’ earthly life was marked with such wonder because this was the next step for Jesus, who was more than just a great teacher or a prophet. Jesus was the only person ever to live a sinless life. He was both fully human and fully God. God could have announced the birth of Jesus in a king’s palace, yet he sent his angles to shepherds."

   "movie_description": "Baptism links Christian believers to the foundation of their faith and the central event of human history – the death of Jesus on the cross for our sins. When the prophet, John the Baptist, baptized Jesus, a voice from heaven said, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.” John the Baptist preached a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sin. Many people came to hear John preach, to confess their sins, repent and be baptized. John told them: “After me will come one more powerful than I, the thongs of his sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.” So, when John baptized Jesus in the river and he was coming up out of the water, the heavens opened and the voice of God said, “You are my beloved son, in you I am well- pleased.” The Spirit of God descended like a dove and landed on Jesus in fulfillment of the Isaiah’s prophecy (Isa 11:2; 42:1). The next day when John the Baptist saw Jesus coming toward him he exclaimed, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world” (John 1:29). Then John the Baptist gave this testimony: “I saw the Spirit come down as a dove and remain on him. I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’ I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God” (John 1:33-34)."

   "movie_description": "It is hard to watch this reenactment of Jesus being crucified. So why do Christians insist on focusing on this brutal event? Many people want to remember Jesus as a good man, even a great prophet, but they insist on denying his crucifixion. Denying Jesus’ crucifixion corrupts God’s merciful work for all of humanity. Because of Jesus’ crucifixion our sinful nature was put to death on the cross with Christ. God pronounced that our sinful nature can produce no good thing. He regards sin as an utterly corrupt, useless thing, by passing a sentence of death upon it and nailing it to the cross with Christ. Through this painful act of crucifixion, God put to death the sinful nature of those who repent of their sins and place their faith in Jesus Christ. The Apostle Paul writes in Romans 6:6 that Christian believers are “crucified with him.” And he goes on to say in Romans 6:11, “So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.” To the world, this belief seems foolish. Yet, this horrible act produced the greatest blessing for the world and achieved what human wisdom has not accomplished-the release of man from sin’s bondage.\n7 – د عذاب او مرګ ځای\nپر صلیب باندې د عیسی په دارکولو نظارت او لیدل اسانه کار نه دی ، خو ولې مسیحیان په دې ظالمانه پیښې باندې يې سر سخت متمرکز دي؟ دېر خلک غواړي چې عیسی د یوه ښه انسان او حتی د ارشد پیامبر په توګه یې په یاد ولري، خو په غوڅه د هغه له دارځړولو څخه ډډه کوي. د صلیب پر مخ د عیسی د دارځړولوڅخه د ډډه په برخه کې د مهربانی په وړاندې د بشریت تحقیر کوي. پر صلیب باندې د عیسی په دار کولو سره یو ځای د ګنهکار انسان طبیعت هم مري. خدای حکم ورکړ چې هیڅ ښه څیز نشي کولای چې د انسان د ګنهکار طبیعت حاصل وي . هغه ګناه یو باطل او وحشیانه عمل وګڼلو ، د هغه محکمه یې اعلام کړه له مسیح سره یو ځای د صلیب پر سر منازعه کېږي. د هغه له ګناه نه د ډک عمل له کبله چې خدای یې د صلیب پر مخ په دار کړو. د هغه کسانو ګنهکار خصلت چې له خپلوګناوو څخه یې توبه وکړه او په مسح عیسی یی باور وکړ د هغوی دا خصلت مري. پاول رسول رومیانو ته داسې ولیکل:6:6 چې مسیحی معتقدان له د سره یوځای په دار شول. په دې پسې یې رومیانو ته وویل:6:11 که چېرې دویم ځلی له مسیحیانو سره یو ځای مړه شو نو ایمان لرم چې له عیسی مسیح سره به ژوند وکړو. دغه عقیده او باور د خلکو په نظر احمقانه ښکاریدو . دغه وحشتناکه پیښه د بشر لپاره د برکت او لوی نعمت وګرځیده . په هغه څه چې د انسان پوهه په هغه نده موفقه شوې ، انسان د ګناه له قید او اسارت څخه معافیت او ازادی ته ورسید."

   "movie_description": "Jesus’ crucifixion has never been the end of the story. In fact, in many ways, it is the beginning. When Jesus appeared in the room with the disciples, he calmed their fears, wished them peace, and then began showing them how he was the fulfillment of God’s promises in the Old Testament. Look at Luke 24:44. Jesus clearly identified himself as the one who would fulfill God’s Old Testament promises. The Apostle Paul would later sum up this good news by saying “that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried; and that he rose again the third day, according to the scriptures” (I Cor 14:4). If Christ did not rise from the dead, the faith of Christians is in vain. There was is no gospel, unless he who died for mankind’s sins, rose again. All the doubt that crashed in on the disciples as Jesus died was erased in a moment when the angel said to the women at the tomb, “Why do you seek the living among the dead? He is not here, but has risen” (Luke 24:5-6)."
