     "movie_description": "When was the last time you were amazed? When was the last time you confronted something with such wonder that you stood and just marvelled? There are two things that happen. First, you stop what you are doing and then admire what is wonderful. The night of Jesus’ birth, angels in heaven and humans on earth, stopped what they were doing and drew together in awe. And the angel said to them, “fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.” The start of Jesus’ earthly life was marked with such wonder because this was the next step for Jesus, who was more than just a great teacher or a prophet. Jesus was the only person ever to live a sinless life. He was both fully human and fully God. God could have announced the birth of Jesus in a king’s palace, yet he sent his angles to shepherds."

     "movie_description": "Baptism links Christian believers to the foundation of their faith and the central event of human history – the death of Jesus on the cross for our sins. When the prophet, John the Baptist, baptized Jesus, a voice from heaven said, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.” John the Baptist preached a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sin. Many people came to hear John preach, to confess their sins, repent and be baptized. John told them: “After me will come one more powerful than I, the thongs of his sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.” So, when John baptized Jesus in the river and he was coming up out of the water, the heavens opened and the voice of God said, “You are my beloved son, in you I am well- pleased.” The Spirit of God descended like a dove and landed on Jesus in fulfillment of the Isaiah’s prophecy (Isa 11:2; 42:1). The next day when John the Baptist saw Jesus coming toward him he exclaimed, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world” (John 1:29). Then John the Baptist gave this testimony: “I saw the Spirit come down as a dove and remain on him. I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’ I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God” (John 1:33-34)."

I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’ I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God” (John 1:33-34)."

     "movie_description": "Baptism links Christian believers to the foundation of their faith and the central event of human history – the death of Jesus on the cross for our sins. When the prophet, John the Baptist, baptized Jesus, a voice from heaven said, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.” John the Baptist preached a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sin. Many people came to hear John preach, to confess their sins, repent and be baptized. John told them: “After me will come one more powerful than I, the thongs of his sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.” So, when John baptized Jesus in the river and he was coming up out of the water, the heavens opened and the voice of God said, “You are my beloved son, in you I am well- pleased.” The Spirit of God descended like a dove and landed on Jesus in fulfillment of the Isaiah’s prophecy (Isa 11:2; 42:1). The next day when John the Baptist saw Jesus coming toward him he exclaimed, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world” (John 1:29). Then John the Baptist gave this testimony: “I saw the Spirit come down as a dove and remain on him. I would not have known him, except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’ I have seen and I testify that this is the Son of God” (John 1:33-34)."

Does the universe even acknowledge our small spec of dirt in the mighty scheme of things? We seem so insignificant, a whiff of air, a breath and in a second we’re gone. Where is God in all this? Does He care? Jesus says He does. Jesus teaches us how to speak to God and how to address Him. And most wonderful of all is he tells us to address God as our Father… FATHER. That He’s as close to us as the air we breath. That He’s got a Kingdom and wants us to be part of it and share in His glorious plans for His creation. Jesus taught his twelve disciples how to pray and it changed their lives and it can change our lives, as well."

Many people want to remember Jesus as a good man, even a great prophet, but they insist on denying his crucifixion. Denying Jesus’ crucifixion corrupts God’s merciful work for all of humanity. Because of Jesus’ crucifixion our sinful nature was put to death on the cross with Christ. God pronounced that our sinful nature can produce no good thing.

Jadi mengapa orang Kristian bertegas untuk menumpukan pada kejam ini? Ramai orang mahu mengingati Yesus sebagai seorang yang baik, bahkan seorang nabi yang hebat, tetapi mereka mendesak menyangkal penyalibannya. Menyangkal penyaliban Yesus merusak kerja keras Allah bagi semua manusia. Kerana penyaliban Yesus, sifat berdosa kita dihukum mati di kayu salib dengan Kristus. Tuhan menyatakan bahawa sifat dosa kita tidak dapat menghasilkan sesuatu yang baik. Dia menganggap dosa sebagai satu perkara yang sia-sia, tidak berguna, dengan melepaskan hukuman maut di atasnya dan memalsukannya ke salib dengan Kristus. Melalui tindakan penyaliban yang menyakitkan ini, Tuhan membunuh orang yang berdosa dari dosa-dosa mereka dan meletakkan iman mereka kepada Yesus Kristus. Rasul Paulus menulis dalam Roma 6: 6 bahawa orang percaya Kristen”disalibkan dengan dia. Dan dia terus berkata dalam Roma 6:11,”Oleh itu, kamu juga harus menganggap diri kamu mati kepada dosa dan hidup kepada Allah di dalam Kristus Yesus.” Kepada dunia, kepercayaan ini kelihatannya bodoh. Walau bagaimanapun, tindakan yang dahsyat ini menghasilkan berkat terbesar bagi dunia dan mencapai apa yang tidak dicapai oleh kebijaksanaan manusia-pelepasan manusia dari perbudakan dosa."

Yet, this horrible act produced the greatest blessing for the world and achieved what human wisdom has not accomplished-the release of man from sin’s bondage.\n7 – ጎልጎታ\nኢየሱስ የተሰቀለበትን ይህን የዝግጅት መግለጫ መመልከት አይከብድም. ታዲያ ክርስቲያኖች ጭካኔ በተሞላበት ሁኔታ ላይ ትኩረት እንዲያደርጉ አጥብቀው የሚጥሉት ለምንድን ነው? ብዙ ሰዎች ኢየሱስ እንደ ጥሩ ሰው, እንደ አንድ ታላቅ ነቢይ እንኳ ሊያስታውሱት ይፈልጋሉ, ነገር ግን ስቅለቱን ለመካድ ይክዳሉ. የኢየሱስ መሰቀል የእግዚአብሔርን መሐሪ ሥራ ለሰው ዘር ሁሉ ይበዛል. የኢየሱስ በመስቀል ላይ ኀጢአተኛው ተፈጥሮአችን ከክርስቶስ ጋር በመስቀል ላይ ተገድሏል. እግዚአብሔር ኃጢአተኛው ተፈጥሮአችን ምንም መልካም ነገር እንደማይሰራ ተናግሯል. ኃጢአትን ሙሉ በሙሉ ብልሹ እና ዋጋ ቢስ ነገር ነው, በእሱ ላይ ሞትን በመውሰድ እና ከክርስቶስ ጋር በመስቀል ላይ በመከራ እንጨት ላይ በመስቀል. በዚህ አሰቃቂ የስቅለት ድርጊት, እግዚአብሔር ከኃጢአታቸው ንስሐ የሚገቡ እና በኢየሱስ ክርስቶስ ላይ እምነትን የጣሉ የኃጢአተኝነት ተፈጥሮን ይገድላቸዋል. ሐዋሪያው ጳውሎስ በሮሜ ምዕራፍ 6 ቁጥር 6 እንደፃፈው ክርስቲያን አማኞች”ከእሱ ጋር ተሰቅለዋል. በሮሜ 6 11 እንዲህ ይቀጥላል,”እንዲሁም እናንተ ደግሞ ለኃጢአት እንደ ሞታችሁ: ግን በክርስቶስ ኢየሱስ በጌታችን ሆናችሁ ለእግዚአብሔር ሕያዋን እንደ ሆናችሁ ራሳችሁን ቈጠሩ. ሆኖም, ይህ አሰቃቂ ድርጊት ለዓለም ሁሉ ታላቅ በረከትን ያመጣና የሰው ጥበብ ያልሰራውን, ማለትም ከኃጢአተኛው ባርነት ነጻ እንዲወጣ አድርጓል."

Many people want to remember Jesus as a good man, even a great prophet, but they insist on denying his crucifixion. Denying Jesus’ crucifixion corrupts God’s merciful work for all of humanity. Because of Jesus’ crucifixion our sinful nature was put to death on the cross with Christ. God pronounced that our sinful nature can produce no good thing. He regards sin as an utterly corrupt, useless thing, by passing a sentence of death upon it and nailing it to the cross with Christ.

Jadi mengapa orang Kristen bersikeras untuk berfokus pada peristiwa brutal ini? Banyak orang ingin mengingat Yesus sebagai orang baik, bahkan seorang nabi besar, namun mereka bersikeras untuk menolak penyalibannya. Menyangkal penyaliban Yesus merusak karya belas kasih Allah untuk semua umat manusia. Karena penyaliban Yesus, sifat berdosa kita telah mati di kayu salib dengan Kristus. Tuhan mengatakan bahwa sifat berdosa kita tidak menghasilkan hal yang baik. Dia menganggap dosa sebagai hal yang benar-benar korup dan tidak berguna, dengan menjatuhkan hukuman mati ke atasnya dan memakukannya ke kayu salib dengan Kristus. Melalui tindakan penyaliban yang menyakitkan ini, Tuhan mematikan sifat berdosa dari orang-orang yang bertobat dari dosa-dosa mereka dan menempatkan iman mereka kepada Yesus Kristus. Rasul Paulus menulis dalam Roma 6: 6 bahwa orang-orang percaya Kristen disalibkan dengan Dia. Dan dia melanjutkan dengan mengatakan dalam Roma 6:11, Jadi kamu juga harus menganggap dirimu telah mati terhadap dosa dan hidup bagi Allah dalam Kristus Yesus. Bagi dunia, kepercayaan ini nampak bodoh. Namun, tindakan mengerikan ini menghasilkan berkah terbesar bagi dunia dan mencapai apa yang belum pernah dilakukan oleh hikmat manusia – pelepasan manusia dari perbudakan dosa."

Ancak neden Hıristiyanlar bu vahşi olay üzerinde odaklanmaktadır ? Bir çok insan İsa’yı iyi bir insan, hatta büyük bir peygamber olarak hatırlamak istiyor, ancak çarmıha gerilişi kesinlikle reddediyor. İsa’nın çarmıha gerilişinin reddedilmesi Tanrı’nın bütün insanlık için gösterdiği merhametli eylemi önemsizleştiriyor. İsa’nın çarmıha gerilmesiyle birlikte çarmıhta İsa ile birlikte insanoğlunun günahkar doğası da ölüyor. Tanrı iyi olan hiçbir şeyin insanoğlunun günahkar doğasının sonucu olamayacağına hükmediyor. Günahı fevkalade kötü bir şey, anlamsız olgu olarak kabul ediyor, bununla ilgili hükmünü veriyor ve İsa ile birlikte çarmıha geriyor. Çarmıha germekten ibaret olan bu işkenceli eylemle Tanrı günahlarından dolayı tövbe edenlerin ve İsa’ya iman edenlerin günahkar doğasını öldürüyor. Havari Pavlus Romalılara yazdığı yazıda 6:11 :” İsa ile öldüysek eğer, İsa ile yaşayacağımıza da inanıyoruz” diyor. Bu inanç insanlarla aptalca geliyor. Ancak bu korkunç olay insanoğluna verilen en büyük lütfa yol açmaktadır ve insan aklının başaramadığını başarır – insanoğlunun günahın pençesinden kurtarılması."

     "movie_description": "Jesus’ crucifixion has never been the end of the story. In fact, in many ways, it is the beginning. When Jesus appeared in the room with the disciples, he calmed their fears, wished them peace, and then began showing them how he was the fulfillment of God’s promises in the Old Testament. Look at Luke 24:44. Jesus clearly identified himself as the one who would fulfill God’s Old Testament promises. The Apostle Paul would later sum up this good news by saying “that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried; and that he rose again the third day, according to the scriptures” (I Cor 14:4). If Christ did not rise from the dead, the faith of Christians is in vain. There was is no gospel, unless he who died for mankind’s sins, rose again. All the doubt that crashed in on the disciples as Jesus died was erased in a moment when the angel said to the women at the tomb, “Why do you seek the living among the dead? He is not here, but has risen” (Luke 24:5-6)."
